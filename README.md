# :earth_americas: Culturd
Culturd is our final project we had to build for [BeCode](https://github.com/becodeorg). 
We chose to build this project with the React.js framework.
The project consists of two parts: Culturd Workshop & Culturd Food.
The idea behind these products is to connect people from different cultures.

Have a look: [Culturd project](https://culturd.netlify.app/) :eyes:

## :art: Culturd Workshop - Ismi & Valerie
In this part of the project people can find information about the workshops, they can
book workshops and they can contact the team behind Culturd Workshop.
The workshops are centered around 4 countries where participants will get introduced to the culture of their choice.

## :stew: Culturd Food - Wing & Aimal
In this part of the project people can make a profile to sell their (native, authentic) food or they can buy food from sellers.
Users can look at the meals offered, they can search for different kinds of meals, they can add and delete meals and finally they can checkout.
